            <p>He was born in Pilar (Ñeembucú), on June 24, 1889, who would have a great performance in the Chaco War.</p>
            
            <p>He was one of the first Paraguayan officers who knew the Chaco soil, since in 1921 he was in this region of the country commissioned to verify the Bolivian advance in the Pilcomayo area.</p>
            
            <p>He made a brilliant performance with the first operational plans of the Paraguayan army. Once hostilities began, he did an excellent job in organizing the mobilization and preparation of new units and logistical support.</p>
            
            <p>In the post war period, already Brigadier General, Ayala was Minister of War and Navy in the cabinet of Dr. Félix Paiva, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. of the Nation. Ambassador to the government of the United States of America, he joined the Paraguayan Delegation to the San Francisco Conference, which resulted in the creation of the United Nations in 1945.</p>

            <p>- 1st Lieutenant Manuel Irala Fernandez
            
            <p>Born on June 1, 1893 in Concepción, a character who came touched to be a legend, the Paraguayan people would give him the immortal nickname of him: "Yakaré Valija".</p>
            
            <p>The Lt. Irala Fernández stood out during the Chaco War for his distant patrols in the enemy rear, he was a great connoisseur of Chaco soil.</p>

            <p>Yacaré Valija bears that nickname because during the Revolution of 1922 it was introduced to the enemy line unnoticed and it is there that he finds a suitcase made of alligator (crocodile) skin, the suitcase contained a map, location of the rest of the camps and a notebook with thousands of annotated data, town by town.</p>
            
            <p>It was Major Félix Cabrera who congratulated him after that important mission and said: "Nde Manuel, you entered the suitcase like alligator."</p>
            
            <p>After the war he got married and lived until his death on April 2, 1979 in the city of Luque, a city that awarded him as a posthumous tribute, the title of "Favorite Son".</p>
